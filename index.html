                <p class="color">The aim of soccer is to score more goals then your
                     opponent in a 90 minute playing time frame. The match is split up 
                     into two halves of 45 minutes. After the first 45 minutes players 
                     will take a 15 minute rest period called half time. The second 45 
                     minutes will resume and any time deemed fit to be added on by the 
                     referee (injury time) will be accordingly.</p>

                <h2>dribble</h2>
                <p class="color">Basketball is a team sport.
                    Two teams of five players each try to score by shooting a ball through a hoop elevated 10 feet above the ground.
                    The game is played on a rectangular floor called the court, and there is a hoop at each end.
                    The court is divided into two main sections by the mid-court line.
                    If the offensive team puts the ball into play behind the mid-court line, it has ten seconds to get the ball over the mid-court line.
                    If it doesn't, then the defense gets the ball.
                    Once the offensive team gets the ball over the mid-court line, it can no longer have possession of the ball in the area behind the midcourt line.
                    If it does, the defense is awarded the ball.</p>

                <p class="color">Baseball is a sport that dates back as far as 1744 and
                     formats of the game have been in place until the modern era today.
                      The game is predominantly big in North America, Canada and Japan.
                       The game is played worldwide with the pinnacle of sport coming 
                       from the World Series of Baseball. Ironically, this event is only
                        competed by North American teams.</p>

                <h2>freestyle</h2>
                <p class="color">Olympic swimming uses four basic swimming styles or
                     strokes. Freestyle, backstroke, breaststroke, and butterfly 
                     (or all four within one raceâ€”that is called the IM or individual 
                     medley).There are 16 swimming pool events for men and women 
                     swimmers in the modern Olympic Games. In 2008 an open water, 
                     10-kilometer marathon swimming race was added to the Olympic 
                     Swimming program.</p>

                <p class="color">American Football is one of the biggest North American 
                    sports. Whilst the game is played worldwide, the professional leagues
                    in North America (such as the NFL) easily attract the best players in
                    the world making its leagues the most competitive. The pinnacle of 
                    the sport comes in the form of the Super Bowl played out every year
                    to millions of people around the world.</p>

                <p class="color">Karate, unlike Japanese Judo is primarily a striking 
                    art and involves the use of punches, kicks, knee and elbow strikes 
                    and various other striking techniques. Some forms of karate may also
                    include a small amount of throws, joint locks and grappling, though
                    it is as an exciting striking art that Karate is known.</p>
